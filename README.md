# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

This analysis is utilized to determine the number of retiring employees by their title and identify all employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help the company replace all mentors who are soon to retire.

### Results:
•	One major step in completing deliverable 1 is that there was a lot of data to clean. We had to sort through data of employees that had changed multiple roles and keep only the most recent role.

•	 Another major point is to use alias to clean up my code and keep things short. By referring to my columns by using the first letter of the table as an alias.

•	One major point about deliverable two, is this is only checking for employees born in one year. So now, you must repeat this process every year to get new mentors which can be tedious. 

•	A second point about deliverable two is the first and last names are separated, so for presentable data I would concat the names then add them to my presentation. 

### Summary:
